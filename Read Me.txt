I used the newest version of LOVE 2D and some of the functions in plush.lua were changed, so that's why there are 
two plush files. I will let on default the one was used on the lecture, but also will make a copy of the plush that runs
in the Version of Love I used (plush_newer_version.lua) just in case it's needed.


My work:

 For pause: 
Created a Pause state. Had to change some code from PlayState.lua, CountDown.lua and main.lua. 
What I did was to save the data from the PlayState on PauseState and render them, without updating, so
it makes the impression of pause the game (adding that in PauseState the Ground and Background speed are
turned to 0, so they don't move)

 For random pipe generation:     
Just made the values of timer in PlayState go random with the math.random function, and the same thing with the GAPs
on PipePairs. The random value goes in the Update function to make it variate all over the game.

 For medals: 
Created a new class, were the Y position and the images (I made on photoshop) were added. On PlaySate the score was
passed to the medal Class and with some conditionals the images and the messages are rendered. 

For the bird's outline just created new bird's images with them, and in the bird function and the score value render
the bird in the differents images according to conditionals.

 For the limits:
Just added a conditional on the Bird class where you can't jump when you're higher than y=0, and when you touch that
point, it makes you go back one pixel. 

Thanks.
